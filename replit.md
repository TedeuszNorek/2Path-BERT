# BERT+GNN Research Platform

## Overview

This is a scientific research platform that combines BERT-based text processing with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for semantic relationship extraction and analysis. The platform provides an interactive Streamlit interface for researchers to experiment with different model configurations, extract relationships from text, and export research data for academic analysis.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Streamlit-based web interface** providing an interactive research environment
- Multi-page layout with sidebar configuration panel
- Real-time visualization of graphs and relationship networks
- Export functionality for research data in CSV format

### Backend Architecture
- **BERT Processor**: Uses spaCy's BERT-based models for semantic relationship extraction
- **GNN Models**: Implements multiple Graph Neural Network architectures:
  - RGCN (Relational Graph Convolutional Networks)
  - CompGCN (Composition-based Graph Convolutional Networks)
  - RGAT (Relational Graph Attention Networks)
- **Graph Processing**: NetworkX-based graph construction and analysis
- **Visualization Engine**: Plotly-based interactive graph visualizations

## Key Components

### 1. Text Processing Pipeline
- **BERT-based extraction** using spaCy's English language model
- Temperature-controlled processing for varying extraction diversity
- Relationship extraction with confidence scoring
- Polarity and directness classification

### 2. Graph Neural Networks
- **RGCN Layer**: Handles heterogeneous relationship types with basis decomposition
- **Multi-relational processing**: Supports different edge types in knowledge graphs
- **Attention mechanisms**: RGAT implementation for weighted relationship importance
- **Compositional embeddings**: CompGCN for joint entity-relation representation

### 3. Data Storage
- **SQLite database** for experiment persistence
- Tables for analyses, relationships, and entities
- Experiment tracking with model configurations and performance metrics
- Simple database interface without external dependencies

### 4. Research Export System
- **Academic CSV format** with elements and connections structure
- Experiment comparison across different model configurations
- Temperature study exports for parameter analysis
- Research data aggregation and statistics

## Data Flow

1. **Input Processing**: Text input → BERT relationship extraction → Structured relationships
2. **Graph Construction**: Relationships → NetworkX graph → Community detection
3. **GNN Enhancement**: Graph + Model selection → Enhanced embeddings → Improved relationships
4. **Visualization**: Processed data → Plotly visualizations → Interactive interface
5. **Export**: Research data → CSV format → Academic analysis
